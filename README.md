Personal To-do list 

This To-Do List Application is a Python-based command-line tool that allows users to manage tasks by adding, viewing, marking them as completed, and deleting them. Tasks are saved in a tasks.json file for persistence between sessions. It provides an easy way to organize and track tasks.
